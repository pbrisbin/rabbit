# Rabbit

I'm re-writing [aurget][] in ruby. This is purely as a learning exercise to 
get me up to speed with ruby for my new job.

I have no idea how far I'm going to take it. Right now it's just 
something to play with.

## Installation

If you're so inclined...

    git clone https://github.com/pbrisbin/rabbit
    rake install

**Note that it's not always in a working state.**

[aurget]: https://github.com/pbrisbin/aurget
