# Rabbit

I'm re-writing [aurget][] in ruby. This is purely as a learning exercise to 
get me up to speed with ruby for my new job.

I have no idea how far I'm going to take it. Right now it's just 
something to play with.

### Installation

If you're so inclined...

1. Install the `jeweler` gem
2. Clone this repo
3. `rake install`

Note that it's not always in a working state.
